# MDS EDC Versions

MDS EDC follows Semantic Version (SemVer) to version its releases.

Our definition for **how** different parts of the version increase is as follows:

- Major: indicates breaking changes. This part is increased when an edc upstream release introduces breaking changes (Management API changes or DSP changes)
- Minor: increased with new features.
- Patch: increased with new hotfixes and security patches.
