# Contributing to MDS EDC

## How to Contribute

### Discuss

If you want to share an idea to further enhance the project or discuss potential use cases, please feel free to create a discussion at the GitHub Discussions page.
If you feel there is a bug or an issue, contribute to the discussions in existing issues otherwise [create a new issue](#create-an-issue).

### Create an Issue

If you have identified a bug or want to formulate a working item that you want to concentrate on, feel free to create a new issue at our project's corresponding GitHub Issues page. Before doing so, please consider searching for potentially suitable existing issues.

If an issue appears to cover changes that will have a (huge) impact on the code base and needs to first be discussed, or if you just have a question regarding the usage of the software, please create a discussion before raising an issue.

Please note that if an issue covers a topic or the response to a question that may be interesting for other developers or contributors, or for further discussions, it should be converted to a discussion and not be closed.

### Submit a Pull Request

We welcome contributions through pull requests! If you'd like to contribute code, documentation, or other improvements:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes
2. Make your changes, ensuring they follow the project's coding standards
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you've changed and why

For significant changes, please consider creating an issue or discussion first to align with the project's direction.
